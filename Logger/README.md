# Comments to Evaluators:
    1. The FileLogging was originally tested and executed using Mac, which has a different file-save path than Windows. The
    used file path is included in case Logging is to be tested on Windows or on Mac. 

    2. Both of the required class files (the custom Logger file and the custom Log provider file) are implemented in the 'FileLogger.cs'
    file inside of this project. We nested them because they work together and did not contain any code that needed to be separated for
    concerns. 

    Note: The FileLogger class implementation for Assignment 8 - Agario comes from the Assignment 7 - Networking code.
