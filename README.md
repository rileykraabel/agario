# Overview of Agario Functionality
    1. The Agario model is capable of playing a functional game. Upon death, the user should exit the browser and re-run the window, 
    as the disconnect method was unfortunately not able to be implemented as hoped.

    Working functionality includes connecting a user to the server, drawing the world accordingly and allowing the user to split, eat
    and die by other users. While not ideal, the zooming functionality is also not included as it did not cooperate across platforms. 

# Partnership
    1. Functionality through 'lincolnsbranch' branch was created mostly by Lincoln Knowles, while the 'master' branch was created by Riley Kraabel.
    We needed to use separate branches because of Git errors and operating system errors. The code would not compile using the other's operating system, 
    ultimately leading us to create two branches with complete functionality on both, but for each operating system. The 'master' branch was created for
    Windows (because debugging through the Mac branch did not work), and 'lincolnsbranch' was created for Mac. 

    2. The merge process for this assignment was difficult because of lack of overlap. There were not a lot of pieces in the code that were able to merge
    effectively because of weird functional errors through operating systems. Therefore, we could not entirely merge each others branches. I created the GUI
    prior to writing the rest of the code, but this had trouble running through Mac and therefore caused a branch off. 

# Testing
    1. For this assignment, we did not use MSTests or any tests similar. It was mainly through debugging and running the application that debugging occurred, 
    which proved to be a large error as we were unable to help the other debug their code. Due to scheduling issues, we were unable to meet as often as
    preferred and could not assist in debugging each others' projects. 

    2. The code can be assumed 'correct' through thorough tests using the debugger and running the application. We tried to use every instance throughout the GUI
    and determine whether or not it was working as planned using breakpoints and local tabs.

# Time Expenditures:
    1. Assignment Eight:   Predicted Hours: 15   Actual Hours: 25   Note: time struggled to be spent effectively; there were lots of bottlenecks.

    2. I would say that my estimates honestly are getting a little bit off. I have really only been taking into account the time it -should- take
    to finish the problem (without conceptual setbacks or bottlenecks). It has been a little challenging to keep on track with the predicted time
    and I think I would benefit from more conceptual help prior to diving deep into the assignment, as this can set me back a long ways.
